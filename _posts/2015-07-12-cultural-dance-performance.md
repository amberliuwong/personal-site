The humidity here is nothing I have comparison for, yet we are learning to accept that yes, we might continually be covered in sweat. Sometimes the second you step out of a shower. The rain is constant and beautiful.

The other night we saw a cultural dance performance showcasing a very diverse Filipino dance tradition. The first half was of native Filipino dances, while the second half was the Spanish influenced dances that the Filipinos have taken as their own. It was a stunning performance, and the costumes were beautiful.

In the first half, the women’s skirts were of dark tapestry-like fabrics, woven with a color palate of deep, geometric patterns. They were paired with simple white blouses, and beaded jewelry and headpieces. Their facial expressions were what captured me the most. Their eyes were cast downward, lips pursed, and with a modest tranquility about them. Sometimes they shyly lifted when one of the men approached them. Their movements were fluid and deliberate, often slowly rocking from foot to foot, arms imitating the wings of birds, and flingers flicking like insects. There was a stoic presence about them when they moved, because while their eyes were lowered, their head and chest were held high.

The males wore high, feathered headdresses with jewelry made of beads and horn. They were shirtless, save the dark tapestry fabric worn down the front and back, and secured at the waist. They entered with shouts, and jumps in unison, beckoning the women onto the stage. The men moved with great power and energy, filling up the space with their presence.

The dynamic between the two genders was fascinating, and a very interesting juxtaposition. It made the contrasting qualities of each dancer stand out that much more.

The second half was extremely different. The women wore glamorous smiles as they floated on stage in long, gauzy evening gowns and heeled white slippers. Their skirts were full and laced with sequins, and they had pastel flowers pinned in their hair. The men wore similar white chiffon shirts and black pants and shoes. The couples waltzed around each other, with delicately curved arms and chins held high. It was almost jarring how different the native Filipino dances were from the Spanish influenced ones, but it shows so much about the history and culture of the Philippines.

Following the waltz numbers, the stage was filled with fishermen in plaid, complete with fishing nets and hoops. For this folk dance, the scene was playful: the women scurried around in groups and giggled at the men trying to catch them in their fishing nets. Another spirited folk dance conveyed a woman dancing with a straw hat. A group of the townsmen danced around her trying to steal the hat, launching themselves to her outstretched arm.

And last but not least, the tinikling dance! This dance also originated during the Spanish colonial era and involves tapping and beating two bamboo poles against each other and on the floor with one or more dancers gracefully jumping in and out of the poles. This takes such precise coordination and agility. The name comes from the tikling species of bird – tinikling means tikling-like. The dance imitates the birds flitting between grass stems, running up tree branches, and dodging bamboo traps set by rice farmers.

Afterwards, the dancers brought out eight poles for us to try! I hope to see more of these stunning performances, and learn some of the dances.
