We traveled long and far to get here: I flew from JFK in NY, to LAX in LA for our one day staging orientation. We met a lot of people in a very short amount of time for our general safety and logistics training. We were divided into 9 groups alphabetically, and I volunteered to be group leader to herd us from the airport to Manila! It was fun shepherding my ducklings around, and I successfully didn’t lose anyone.

Then, as a group, all 88 of us mobbed LAX airport with our massive amounts of luggage to catch our first flight to Tokyo. It was a long 11 hour flight, but went without incident (other than a lack of sleep). Following a 4 hour layover in the Tokyo, we boarded the plane for Manila. For the first hour, we were stuck on the runway in the sweltering humidity without AC for a mechanical problem. Finally we took off to complete the 4 hour flight. Once we landed, we were greeted at the gate in Manila by a host of (very awake) Peace Corps staff with flower leis for us called sampaguita (the Filipino national flower), and airport attendants with baskets of candy. PC staff helped us load our luggage onto two busses to take us an hour to IIRR – the conference center that will be our home for the next two weeks. We finally arrived just after 1am, and were greeted with applause by more PC staff and resource volunteers! They fed our sleep-deprived bodies with coffee, tea, and cookies before quickly briefing us about the morning schedule, and distributing our room keys. We would surely be allowed to sleep in the next morning after 27 hours of travel, right? Nope. After finally getting to bed around 3am, breakfast was bright and early at 6:30 the next morning. Magandang umaga! Good morning!

The first day of Peace Corps Training (PCT) was filled with paperwork for our bank accounts, alien status forms, health forms, urine samples, new cell phones, pictures for PC files, and allowance distribution. As a total of 89 volunteers (we picked one up in Tokyo), we are becoming surprisingly close in this short amount of time. I stick around with my original group 9 often. We bond over our inevitable places at the end of the alphabet. And sometimes other things.

We arrived in the night in the rain, and it hasn’t stopped since then. But this rain is a refreshing rain. The warm showers cuts the humidity (well, sometimes), and amuses me with its tantrum-like downpours every half hour. Here are some pictures from the beautiful IIRR conference campus.

Our days are packed, and we have so much to learn. Sa muling pagkikita! See you later! I’ll have another post up sooner now that I’ve figured out where the best wifi is… We started Tagalog language classes today and I’m so ready to have homework and classwork to do. I’ve missed school!
