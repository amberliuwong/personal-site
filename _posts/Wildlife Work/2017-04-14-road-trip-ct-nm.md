Less than a month ago, I had no idea that I’d be driving alone almost coast to coast- and I that I’d have the most amazing time. Here is my trip in numbers:

* In 2 weeks,
* I drove over 2,900 miles,
* In 57 hours,
* Crossing 15 states,
* Making 13 stops at the homes of friends and family, and new friends and new family,
* Attended a beautiful wedding,
* Met family members I didn’t know I had,
* And started a new job!

I got to see friends and professors from F&M College, coworkers from the Belize Jaguar Project, friends I studied abroad in India with over 4 years ago, friends of friends from Peace Corps, immediate family, as well as extended family I’d never met before, and of course, new friends made along the way. All my worlds collided in this venture that took me to so many places I’ve never been.

I started in Connecticut: then stopped in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and finally New Mexico!

I arrived in New Mexico on Saturday, and today was my first day of work! I work for Cassidi on the Chiricahua (Cheer-i-kawa) leopard frog research on the Ted Turner Ladder Ranch in Caballo. There are many conservation projects going on simultaneously on this massive ranch! I live with Vincent, the technician for the tortoise research here. There are scientists studying wolves, quails, black bears, mountain lions, and more! We all help each other out, so I will get to get involved a little with each project.

Today my boss Cassidi, her crazy work-pup-in-training Luna, and I went out to visit the frog ponds sites to take water quality measurements and do population estimates for the frogs, tadpoles, and egg masses. We will do this at all 18 sites once a month. I drive the UTV, which is like a mountain golf cart with big wheels. Its pretty great. More on the job later, the weather and landscape here is breathtaking!!
