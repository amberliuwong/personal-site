Exactly one week from today, I leave for Belize!

Jaguars, ocelots, and pumas, OH MY!

Following Peace Corps Philippines, I’ve been accepted into a two-month Field Assistant position in Belize, and I am raising funds to cover travel and project fees. This research will take place in the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve in Cayo, Belize, and I’ll be working for wild cat scientist, Dr. Marcella Kelly from Virginia Tech. I am SO excited for this amazing opportunity to break into the wildlife conservation world – and with big cats no less! I leave this week on January 15th!

### Research Details
This research is part of Dr. Kelly’s nearly two-decade long study on population density for three main cats in Belize (jaguars, ocelots, and pumas) using non-invasive detection techniques. The study researches the long-term demographics of jaguar populations and the impacts of selective/sustainable logging at multiple sites across Belize.

From this Field Assistant position I will gain extensive, hands-on field experience with large remote camera grids, conducting habitat surveys, orienteering with GPS and map and compass, and entering and maintaining a database. Chances are, I won’t see a cat. They are active in dawn and dusk hours, and full moon nights, and they are extremely elusive. I’ll keep my expectations for a sighting low, so if I do see a cat — I can’t even imagine what that will feel like!
