After Belize, I was hired for a job in New Mexico!

I will be heading to New Mexico, The Land of Enchantment, as a Wildlife Technician for the next 6 months. I will be working for the Turner Endangered Species Fund, assisting a biologist with her research on the Chiricahua Leopard Frog. This species is listed as threatened by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Working with endangered species, big and small, furry or slimy, I take my next step into the wildlife field. I’m excited to live and work in a new environment in the stunning New Mexico!

The symbol in the middle of the New Mexican flag is the ancient sacred sun of the Native American Zia tribe. Four is a sacred number for the Zia, representing the four directions, four seasons, four times of day (morning, noon, evening, night), and four stages/cycles of life (childhood, youth, adulthood, old age).

“Zia’s belief that with life comes four sacred obligations: one must develop a strong body, a clear mind, a pure spirit, and a devotion to the welfare of others.” -State Symbols USA
