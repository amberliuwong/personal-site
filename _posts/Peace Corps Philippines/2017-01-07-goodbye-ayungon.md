In November of this year, I decided to leave Peace Corps Philippines.

Saying goodbye to my loving host family was the hardest thing I’ve had to do in my service. The turnaround and decision to leave happened very fast after our MST, or Mid-Service Training.

In short, I decided to leave because Peace Corps Philippines helped me discover what is what I want to do, and ultimately I left to pursue it. I finally figured out what I want to be when I grow up.

After MST, I took a week with some close PCVs to vacation in the mountains of northern Luzon and mull over what leaving the country would mean for me. The mountains were cool and refreshing, and the breath of fresh air I needed from the humid coastlines. When I returned to site, I had to break the news to my wonderful Filipino family on my birthday, November 6th. They understood, and showed me all the love and support they always do. I cleared out my room that day and gave away almost everything I had to my family. They joked about how I gave them all presents on my birthday instead of the other way around. I felt a weight off my shoulders with their blessings in understanding my tough decision.

In my last week at site, I told my officemates and thanked them for their friendship and help in learning my way through Filipino culture. I submitted final documents for my office, and packed my two bags for Manila.

I flew to Manila on a Sunday afternoon, chaotically had only one day to complete end-of-service paperwork at headquarters on Monday, and was in the Manila airport to fly back to the US at 5:45am Tuesday morning. It was a flurry of a weekend.

I miss my Filipino family and PCV friends so much. I feel lucky I got to see friends at MST before I left, and got to say some goodbyes. Thank you all for everything.

Here are some photos of my last days in the Philippines~
