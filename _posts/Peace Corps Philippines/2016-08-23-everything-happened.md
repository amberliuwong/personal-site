These past three months have been insane. I’ve been traveling out of site for a week or more, every other week, for Peace Corps work. It’s been exhausting with so many hours spent on transportation, and late nights planning for the next day’s activity, but now that I can take a step back, inhale, and maybe sleep for a week, I know it has been beyond worth it.

I spent two weeks of June in Manila for medical and a RIICE Committee meeting (formerly Diversity Committee), then July was a week at Initial Orientation (IO) in Cavite with the new arrival of Batch 275 for a RIICE session (diversity training).

**What is RIICE?** RIICE is a Peace Corps Philippines committee that PCVs apply to. It was formerly known as Diversity Committee, before this June. The new name change came with an entire Peace Corps organizational vamp from D.C.. Peace Corps countries are focusing diversity trainings during PST with PCVs and in-country PC staff. The name RIICE stands for: Respect, Inclusion, Intercultural, Competency, Equality. (Named by RIICE Committee member, Rocky Magana).

Personally, this is how I define this committee, and my position on it:

*We are a Peace Corps committee that promotes and teaches acceptance. We bring to light the diverse ways people are treated, viewed, and respected (based on differences in gender identity, age, race, religion, health status, sexual orientation, and more), and how this disparity can be changed for the better through education and awareness. We do trainings with PCVs, PC staff, and now, with Host Country Nationals (HCNs) in Diversity Camps. We are a sound board for the PC community, but everyone can be involved with RIICE Com as a Diversity Camp leader, or as an ally or defense to those who are discriminated against.*

I hope this makes it a little clearer on what this committee does. Any questions, feel free to message me! I’ve spent a lot of time and effort with this committee in the past three months, and I love it. I am going to do everything it takes to make sure this Diversity Camp happens again next year!

One week later, I traveled to Daet, Camarines Norte with RIICE again to hold Peace Corps Philippines’ first ever Diversity Camp!! I’m not exaggerating when I say that this was the most amazing experience I’ve ever had in my life. This camp focused on important social topics that delved deep into the participants’ minds, and questioned assumptions and stereotypes they may have held before. We held a Training of Trainers (ToT) with these nine ESGP-PA scholar Youth Facilitators to lead the 3 day overnight camp with about 50 of their peers.

**The camp in numbers:**
* 1 year of planning with
* 1 committee of dedicated PCVs and PC staff with
* 7 PCVs leading a camp with
* 3 Camarines Norte State college staff for
* 2 days Training of Trainers (ToT) for
* 9 ESGP-PA youth facilitators who led
* 47 ESGP-PA participants in a
* 3 day overnight camp with
* 5 difficult but important topics at
* 1 Camarines Norte State College campus for a more than sucessful Diversity Camp!

Hopefully this is the first of many Diversity Camps through Peace Corps Philippines. Youth facilitators addressed the topics of HIV/AIDS, gender, race/IP communities, LGBTQ, and people with disabilities.

Directly after returning from the camp (two straight days of travel – two 9-hour buses, a 2.5-hour bus, an hour flight, and some trikes in between, each way), I went straight to Dumaguete for a week of our PC Project Design and Management (PDM) Workshop. (Now we can apply for PC grants!)

I had one week back at site, where our LBAT (Local Biophysical Assessment Team) did seagrass assessments! I did a quick training with LGU members, then we went out into the water! Even though it was cloudy and rainy, I still managed to get a funky shorts tan -_- haha and even with the rain, high winds, and rising tide by the afternoon, our team stayed positive and got 8 transects done in two barangays! [Please note our TOTALLY AWESOME MATCHING AYUNGON PRIDE RASHGUARD SHIRTS]

Then I was off to Morong, Bataan for a week as a CRM Environmental Education Resource Volunteer for the 275’s Pre-Service Training (PST)! I shared my experience as a PCV, one year in, as well as what it’s like to do environmental education in the Philippines. It was so nice to live back in Sabang, Morong and visit my host family again! I got to know the new CRM trainees while they worked on their CEP document and finished up language classes before their LPI – language exam!

I’ve since returned to site, and I’m ready to get back to work! Over the past year, I really did have to spend that entire time, slowly learning about my site and Filipino culture, building my connections and credibility in my community, and simply learning through experience and observation. Now, I’ve got the practicality and motivation to really dive into this last year of service and do what I’ve come here for: training and educating others about CRM and spreading international peace and friendship.

On my way to work the Monday after my return, I greeted so many people on the street that noticed I was gone – and that meant everything. They were mostly students from Negros College that I’ve crossed paths with in one way or another: hiking club, dancing at fiestas with them, relation to my host family, friends of friends. The feeling of coming home after travel is an experience like no other. The moment I realized that I am comfortable here in my community, happy, and healthy was very distinct for me.

Needless to say, being a Peace Corps Volunteer is a completely separate experience for each person, even in the same country, same island, or even same municipality. For me, finding this comfort, within the challenges of service, took a while. Almost an entire year in fact, that at times seemed slow and lonely. It is still testing my patience, endurance, motivation, and commitment to this job. I am excited for what this year ahead holds for me!
