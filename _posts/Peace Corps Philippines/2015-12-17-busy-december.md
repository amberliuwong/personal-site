Many things have happened in the past month. I’ve begun two main projects in my work here in Ayungon. The first is to help strengthen People’s Organizations (POs such as Women’s Groups, Youth Groups, etc. I’ll be starting with Fisherfolk Associations). The second is facilitating the creation of an Environmental Advocacy Club in Negros College.

I have begun the baby steps for both projects, and it’s as exhilarating as ever! I feel like I have a direction now and long-term goals. First I made a preliminary survey for the PO presidents of the eight Fisherfolk Associations in Ayungon. I’ve interviewed all but one at this point in time, so once that is finished I will be creating profiles for each association, joining their meetings, and working with them to increase their presence and activity within the municipality.

The Environmental Advocacy Club leapt off almost immediately! I had a meeting with the Negros College LGU Scholars to present the potential of this club, and we had our first club meeting two days later with interested members. The following weekend, we had our first event – a group hike to Mt. Sampung. During my presentation, I spoke about how we can experience nature and spur awareness and support for the environment. The hike was a great success with about ten new members, and four of us from the original hiking group (Mt. Quisaw and Maaslum Falls). Since the Mt. Sampung hike, members who had to miss it have been constantly asking me when the next hike is! We had our club meeting during the hike, and interesting ideas were brought up: what we can do as an organization, a potential mangrove-planting event linking up with the DA and DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources), how we can involve more members… the gears are turning!

I also got scuba certified last week, funded by LGU! I feel extremely fortunate to have been able to have this opportunity. Along with three DA employees, two policemen, and a Fisherfolk Association President, we underwent a three-day open water scuba certification by Jonathan from San Jose. The first day was in a pool in Amlan, and the last two days were in the reefs along Ayungon’s coastline! It was quite an experience and Jonathan was an amazing instructor.

All within last week, I attended a wedding for the MAO’s beautiful daughter Riche, a funeral for the Mayor’s 40-day-old grandson, and I was asked to be the godmother for a coworker’s niece. Life cycles.

More dance performances ensue, with an intermission dance at the Brgy. Tampucon II Fiesta Pageant Night last week, and a dance presentation with my Dept. of Ag office for the LGU Christmas party tomorrow!

I also completed a write-up for the Marine Mammal and Turtle Rescue and Response Training I did in September.

Today marks three months at our permanent site! Amazing how fast time flies. From today on we have the option of moving out of our host families and/or changing our food situation, and travel restrictions are lifted. (Now we can stay overnight outside of our municipality). As of now I plan on staying with my host family, but slowly starting to cook my own food. Meet my family!

Such a busy month and it’s only the 17th! Christmas day will be spent with my host family, and then from Dec. 26th to Jan. 3rd,  I’ll be in Cebu and Dumaguete celebrating New Years with Peace Corps Volunteers!

Happy holidays everyone!
