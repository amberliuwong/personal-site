Living abroad, working in coastal resource management, and immersing myself in a new culture has been the toughest, most humbling experience I’ve ever had. I am learning so much about myself, my community, and the resilience of humans here, and around the world. Small victories are how I count my days.

I’ve realized that I did not come to the other side of the planet for the big projects or headline-making achievements; I came here as an American, as a human, to promote international peace and friendship. That is why I am here. With the hate and racism that is plaguing our world right now – very much in the US as well as outside of it – I find that my role here, and all Peace Corps Volunteers around the world, is subtle, but important. This is something I must remind often myself when I feel alone, under qualified, or overwhelmed at site. But in the end, one year into service, and just over one year to go, I am happy I took that leap of faith across oceans. Being far from home is difficult now, if you spend anytime following the news about heartless shootings, racism, homophobia, and more. But we are asked to stay neutral as PCVs, so I will stop with that.

I have a lot of time to read here. Every night I default to my kindle or paperbacks. I just finished Jane Goodall’s book, *Hope For the Animals and Their World*, a collection of success stories from biologists, naturalists, animal psychologists, driven students, caring civilians and more, devoting their lives to bringing animals back from the brink of extinction. The book swallowed me.

Jane Goodall is one of my idols, and I had the amazing opportunity to hear her speak at my college, Franklin & Marshall, just over two years ago during my senior year. She had recently celebrated her 80th birthday, and still travels over 300 days out of the year to give her message of of how important it is to protect the environment, animals, and humans that live in it.

People often ask her, “what keeps you going when we hear everyday that a species is lost, a forest flattened, another river polluted?” This is the hope she carries in her pocket – because it has been done and can still be done. She compiled stories of individuals and organizations working tirelessly to protect, heal, revive, and restore what humans have injured before.

And I am reminded that there is hope, for the animals and their world, but also maybe the humans and their world, international peace, friendship, respect, recovery…
