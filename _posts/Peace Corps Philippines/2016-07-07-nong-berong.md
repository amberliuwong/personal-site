One year ago, I got on a plane and flew to the other side of the world. Before, the longest Iâ€™d lived abroad was 6 months, and I have since doubled that time. I left U.S. comforts, family, friends, and familiarity. I didnâ€™t know a word of Cebuano, or a single Peace Corps Philippines volunteer, my hair was 7 inches shorter, I didnâ€™t sweat from so many places, I hadnâ€™t met my two wonderful host families, and I had never seen the beauty of a coral reef or the depths of the tropical ocean. And I didnâ€™t own a hyper-spastic, but loving, pup named Ada. I also never led such a life full of daily surprises.

Suddenly itâ€™s July, and a new batch of volunteers have arrived! And Iâ€™m supposed to be the knowledgeable, veteran volunteer thatâ€™s been here for a year. Right? I was honored to be chosen as a Resource Volunteer for the new CRM batchâ€™s Community Based Training. I am returning to Sabang! I will be facilitating the Environmental Education portion of their training in mid August.

After new years, time flew by. The months blurred into each other and I canâ€™t recall one day from another. Through many many phone calls to fellow PCVs, small victories, and the realization that I have 15 months left of service instead of 27, here I am: alive and well, healthy, sometimes uncertain, but for the most part, happy. I can look forward and know that I will still be living with my host family and our zoo of cats (9 and some on the way) and dogs (4), and that I will still be in connection with PCVs even if they have had to leave the country, for one reason or another.

A few of my friends who have left. I miss you all ðŸ˜¦

My most recent project involves college students, elementary school students, and environmental education modules. I hope to work with Negros College students by training them, in small groups, how to teach environmental ed modules to elementary school students. Training of trainers. Then ideally, we can put these trainings into use in the classrooms in a practicum! Educating exponentially. We will see how it goes.

What has happened since February 19, my last post?

I traveled to Siquijor, the island of witchcraft, for their Healing Festival at the end of March during Holy Week. Even almost 9 months into service, I was still meeting wonderful volunteers I didnâ€™t know from the batch before me!

April was taken over by 3 weeks of Peace Corps Training. We had our In-Service Training that was supposed to be in February, but was pushed back due to budget issues in DC. I had the honor of being a resource volunteer, teaching a session about Marine Mammal and Turtle Stranding Response with Andrew and Bronson.

Following 2 weeks of IST, CRM volunteers had a Coral Gardening workshop at the San Carlos Marine Research Station. There we met young, driven marine biologist Filipinos and Filipinas devoted to rehabilitating the countryâ€™s coral reefs. It was absolutely inspiring. At the end of the workshop, I spontaneously joined a group of volunteers to the beautiful Malapascua Island. There I got my advanced certification for diving, dove 100 feet to swim with stunning thresher sharks, dove in a cave, experienced a terrifying night dive, and met some amazing people at Divelink Cebu! (EVERYONE GO THERE, ITâ€™S AMAZING. One of the few locally owned dive shops on the island!)

May began with a Peace Corps-induced standfast before during and after the Philippine Elections â€“ we were not allowed to leave site/travel for the 4-14th. At the end of that, I experienced my first Ayungon Fiesta! Every municipality has a fiesta once a year to celebrate celebration! Ayungonâ€™s is May 15th every year. It involved a week of preparation in the LGU offices, students were preparing dances, there was Mr. and Miss Ayungon Beauty Pageants, of course, and lots and lots and looooots of food. I also took a trip to Bacolod City on the other side of my island, Negros Island, then Guimaras Island for Manggahan â€“ the Festival of Mangos!

As May ended, Ayunganons are struck by tragedy. A dear friend, fisherman, and leader, dies suddenly from a heart attack at only 60 years old. Oliver Dayupay, or Nong Berong as he was known, was the one fisherman I worked closest with here. We called each other bespren, best friend! He was, as his friends and community members called him, the perfect leader. My counterpart Marju and I had nominated him for Oceanaâ€™s TaÃ±on Strait Heroes Award months before for his lifelong devotion to protecting the ocean. The day before he passed away, I was on the phone with Oceanaâ€™s organizer of the event, scheduling an interview with him as a finalist! (All 12 finalists were getting interviewed, and in 2 weeks time, the 3 winners would be announced live at the award ceremony â€“ one for each region bordering the TaÃ±on Strait: Negros Oriental, Negros Occidental, and Cebu). However, he was in Cebu City for a training with other Fisherfolk Association Presidents, so we were planning his interview remotely.

The next night at 10pm, I get a phone call from Oceanaâ€™s organizer, Ma-an. She tells me Berong died of a heart attack 3 hours earlier. I was shocked, and in tears â€“ I had talked to him on the phone that morning to discuss his interview â€“ his life was taken so fast. And the most tragic part is, Ma-an told me that he won the award for the Negros Oriental region â€“ but he never found out. She was on the phone with him 10 minutes before he died, and he was at a training for Fish Association Presidents. He literally spent his last breaths working for our oceans. He is a true Ocean Hero, and we will be forever grateful.

Two weeks later, we attended the award ceremony in Cebu City, and his wife, Maâ€™am Eden, accepted the award on behalf of her late husband. Oceana decided to give the entire award money of 50,000 pesos (about $1,087 USD) to Berongâ€™s family. His memory lives on through the work and life he has devoted to the oceans. Thank you Oceana for recognizing these amazing fisherfolk who are often forgotten in the larger scheme of ocean conservation.

Rest in peace Nong Berong, you will always be our Ocean Hero.
