So far we’ve had two and a half days of classes. Here is what a normal weekday in IO looks like:

* 6:30am – Many people get up around 5am and work out in groups or on their own. There is a swimming pool here, the campus is a loop, so lots of people run. I got a yoga mat so I can stretch and do crunches in the morning, etc (if I feel like it). PC Resource Volunteers lead circuit training sessions or group runs, etc. every the morning.
* 6:30-8:00am – Breakfast in the canteen. We are spoiled here with the food – rice and salad at every meal, and for breakfast, eggs and bacon, fresh fruit, cereal, toast.
* 8:00-10:00am – Language class. We split into groups of about 15 each for Tagalog class, but on Monday we split into even smaller groups of 5.
* 10:00-10:15am – Marienda! Always mariendas. This is a Filipino tradition: a snack between meals. There is also one later between lunch and dinner.
* 10:15-12:00pm – Technical training for each sector. There are about 30 each in Coastal Resource Management (CRM – me), Children, Youth and Families (CYF), and Education.
* 12:00-1:00pm – Lunch.
* 1:00-3:00pm – Technical Training.
* 3:00-3:15pm – Marienda!
* 3:15-5:00pm – Technical Training. Or a group lecture.
* 5:00-6:00pm – Free time.
* 6:00-8:00pm – Dinner: rice, salad, vegetables, meat: fish/chicken/pork/beef, fruit, soup.
* 8:00-10:00pm – Some sort of optional event: jam session, dance party, Filipino games, talent show, etc.
* 9:00-10:00pm – I’m usually asleep by now.

IO (Initial Orientation) is only two weeks long, but this first week has felt like a month. We are mostly in the IIRR campus, and we aren’t really aloud to leave. However, I learned yesterday that we can walk around outside the campus as long as we’re in groups – but there isn’t much to see in this area. We aren’t in the center of Manila – we are just under an hour and a half from the airport in an area called Cavite. The second week, many people got sick. The two reasons people seem to be sick is: a virus going around (flu-like symptoms), and side affects of the malaria pill (that would be me). I felt nauseous, lack of appetite, diarrhea – all the fun things. I stopped the pill for two days and the symptoms mostly went away. But I’ll have to start it up again at the end of this week before we move to Bataan.

On Monday we got our Language clusters of 5-ish people. After two weeks in Cavite, we move to the next step in PC Training: Community Based Training in Bataan. In Bataan, there are three cities we will be going to – one for each sector. CRM will be in Morong. Within Morong, we will be divided into our language clusters in to three more barangays or neighborhoods, where we will live with our first host family for the next 2+ months. I will be in Sabang. We will be getting very close with our language clusters – we will continue to have language classes with them, technical training (all clusters together), and we will most likely be placed in host families near each other. We have our LPI (Language Placement Interview) on Aug. 24th where we chika chika (chat informally) to gauge our language knowledge level. Three weeks into our time in Bataan, we will be told of our sites! (Week 5) Once we know what site we are placed in, we stop learning Tagalog and start learning our new dialect for the new region.

After finishing our two months in Bataan, we all split up and leave for our permanent site, and new host family. This is my last post before I get to Bataan. I doubt I will have wifi in Sabang, so I may fall off the map for a while. Kita kits! See ya later!
