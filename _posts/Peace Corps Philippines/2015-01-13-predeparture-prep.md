Just under 6 months until I leave for the Philippines!

Yesterday was a whirlwind of excitement as I finally dove into my Peace Corps to do list: I did the LearningSpace tutorials on Health/Safety and the PC Core Expectations, I researched packing lists specifically for the PC Philippines, and I searched blogs of other volunteers also in the Philippines for Coastal Resource Management. I found a wonderful wordpress for a current volunteer there, Tyler Hassig, on the tail end of his journey. He is doing Peace Corps through their Masterâ€™s International Program â€“ 1 year of grad school, 2+ years of Peace Corps, 1 final year of grad school. He is developing his thesis on for his Environmental Studies degree while abroad.

I messaged Tyler through the blog to see if he had any advice for pre-departure, and he responded with recommendations on books and movies to read and watch, history to learn, and what a typical day is like as an environment PC volunteer! He even sent a detailed packing list that he created 1 year into his service â€“ I can tell itâ€™s going to be extremely useful. He informed me that Iâ€™m going to need to acquire some dive gear in the US prior to heading over â€“ something that was never mentioned on any Peace Corps website (or even the Peace Corps Wiki). He suggested getting dive certified while in the Philippines because it is inexpensive and very useful. Iâ€™m so excited!!

I am slowly mentally constructing a packing list, and surveying what I already own and what I need to buyâ€¦ I got a gorgeous 70 liter travel pack for myself for Christmas ðŸ™‚ and I am researching things like: waterproof cameras, dive gear, quick-dry underwear, and adaptors. Ready to go! Maybe.
