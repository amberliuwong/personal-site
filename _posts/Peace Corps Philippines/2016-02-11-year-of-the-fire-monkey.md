Xin nian kuai le! Happy Chinese New Year, Year of the Fire Monkey. This is the first time I am celebrating in Asia, AND it is my year, the year of the monkey. An auspicious and exciting year I hope. I am missing all of my family that we usually celebrate with, eating a huge meal with really good Chinese food, and seeing all my little cousins run around in pigtails and qipao dresses, waving their hong bao (lucky red envelopes) in the air.

I didn’t get a chance to write a New Year’s post in January; everything was a bit crazy with the holidays, and I didn’t have a chance to think things over. However, I feel that this Chinese New Year (Feb 8th) is an even better time to reflect back, remain present, and look forward. This is the year of the Fire Monkey, my year, though not my element (I was born in a Water Monkey year). With this being the elemental year of fire, it’s all about power, energy, and igniting change. However, just as fire can quickly get out of hand, there is an aspect of control that is also a large part of this year. Not containment, because that will put out a fire, but a mindful management that allows the flames to flicker in their beauty – to warm, cook, light, dazzle – but not set the forest on fire.

For this Year of the Fire Monkey, I remind myself to stay honest, communicate, and continue working on my Visaya. Bike more and eat more fruits and vegetables! I also would like to constantly remind myself each volunteer has their own site, with very different resources, people, coworkers, and experiences. It’s hard not to compare with PCV friends, but a constant check-in with myself is always healthy. I am often leaving Ayungon for trainings through work, or through Peace Corps, meaning, the days I am here, I must make the most of it.

The holiday was fun, but hectic, then most of January taken over by two trainings – a three-day zoning workshop in the municipality over, then a two-week training all the way in Laguna, Luzon. Both trainings were with Rare, a conservation organization that Ayungon works closely with, and that I, as a Peace Corps Volunteer, have been woven into the fabric of.

Prior to the training, we had an assignment: shadow two fisherfolk in our municipality for one day each, and create a Day In The Life understanding. This was an amazing opportunity for me. The community I stayed with was close to my office, yet I felt like I was in another world. I struggled with my Visaya, but they were patient and kind with me, and I met many new people I now see everyday. Here are some pictures from my days with fishermen Nestor Vailoces, and Junior Ceriales.

The training in Laguna was on the beautiful University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) campus! The two-week training was called, “Making Markets Work for Nearshore Fishers.” We had a review of Rare’s Pride Campaign process – fostering local pride for the environment backed by social behavior change and science. We also learned about a proven community savings mobilization program called VSLA – Village Savings and Loan Associations that we will implement in Ayungon. Value chain analysis, fish stock monitoring, microfinance organizations, and partnering community development organizations were all part of this wonderful training.

Back in Ayungon, we are firing up the implementation process of VSLA and Value Chain Analysis. We are starting with a courtesy call with the Mayor this week, and debriefing all involved LGU employees who weren’t at the training. Then, courtesy calls with barangay captains and fisherfolk association presidents in each coastal barangay to pitch both programs, set a time to meet association members, and gauge interest. I had a much longer post with details of how VSLA and Value Chain Analysis works, but I don’t want to get too technical here. If you are interested, I can send you some details I didn’t post!

Here’s to a lucky and prosperous new year! Xin nian kuai le!

xoxo, Amber
