In only the first two months here, I often ask myself, “what am I doing here?” Not in an existential *what’s my purpose in life*? More like, but really, what do I do here? What do I do next? I was warned about this! By anyone and everyone who knows how Peace Corps works! The first six months or so is about integration – learning the language (only slightly difficult), learning to get around (not difficult at all), and learning everyone’s names and faces (IMPOSSIBLE). The first six months is not about knowing what you’re doing by any means. And let me tell you, I’m doing great in that department. I’ve been in and out of Ayungon for work more often than normal (I think. But then again, what is normal in Peace Corps…? Don’t answer that. There is no answer.) So as much as I enjoy the trainings, festivals, and traveling, what to do when I return…?

I was just away in Cebu last week with my counterpart Marju, which we thought was a training on Alternative Livelihoods for fisherfolk, but no. It turned out to be a Market Systems Methodology Development Training. So, not alternative livelihoods. Not sure where we misunderstood the communication, but thus it was. There were new things to be learned anyway.

I often don’t know what is going on, whether it is a language barrier, lack of communication, or a misunderstanding, I have to just smile and nod. And laugh. Loooots of laughing. The struggle is REAL.

But oftentimes it ends well.

For example, I developed a light cough last month that greatly concerned my host family and officemates. My coworker, Darryl, told me to drink kalamansi juice to fix it (aka, tiny limes). So the next day I biked to the market and accidentally bought almost a kilo of kalamansi. (For reference, it’s a lot of mini limes. And yes, accidentally. I didn’t mean to buy that much, but hey, miscommunication.) When I came home, my 81 year old Nanay Nora shuffled up to me waving a bulging plastic bag in my face. “I got 100 kalamansi for only TEN PESOS!” 10 pesos. I was thoroughly impressed. I definitely paid twice that amount on my market run. Then at work the following day, Darryl brought another bag of kalamansi for me from his cousin. So I got to work juicing all of these by hand (which doesn’t make much, in case you were planning on juicing two and a half kilos of tiny limes. They are mostly seed.) And by the end of the day, I was overwhelmed with kindness and kalamansi.

And my cough *did* go away. Swear by kalamansi.
