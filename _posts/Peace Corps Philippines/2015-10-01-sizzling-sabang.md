Where do I even begin? I am currently at my permanent site in Ayungon, Negros Oriental, and have not had a chance to write a post for Morong yet. It’s been over two months since my last post and at this point, I’ve had some time to reflect on the CBT (Community Based Training) portion of PST (Pre-service training). (Learn to love our acronyms.)

There were eight of us in Sabang, in two language clusters. We all clicked so well together and I miss them beyond words. In Peace Corps, time simultaneously speeds up and slows down. Years or days could have passed, and I feel like I’ve known some of them much longer than the calendar tells me. This siyempre includes our LCFs and TCFs – Language and Technical facilitators. They became some of my best friends here, and I definitely would not have survived my first few months without them! I miss them and already have plans to see them again around New Years.

Since there is just too much to cover over the past two months, I will focus on a few highlights of CBT: Sabang sunsets, Community Project, and my host family.

I’ve been out of Sabang for just over two weeks now, and I would do anything to see those stunning sunsets again. Before work overwhelmed us, I walked along the beach every evening to watch the sunset. Sadly, by the tail end of our stay, I didn’t have time to go as often as I would’ve liked. My last trip was to Varanasi, India. I went there to see the sun rise over the Ganga River, and I came to Sabang to see the sun set. But pictures say more than words.

So many projects and so much information: all squeezed into under two months in our barangays. But of everything we dipped our feet into, the community project had one of the most fulfilling outcomes. We worked with the community to paint two colorful murals on the side of the barangay hall – a map of the Philippines and an ocean scene, and we helped fix up the main basketball court by repairing fences, repainting lines, cleaning up trash, and giving them new nets for the hoops.

The most amazing part about the project was that community members walking by would simply come and join us in painting and cleaning. Many people dropped by to give us supplies, or worked with us all day (and the morning of the next day) to complete the project. At the end of our Handog (our final party to thank our host families), we invited everyone to add their handprints to the mural.

My host family. Where do I even start? The Lims! My host mother, Lielyn is wonderful, caring, sweet, and so extremely hardworking. And SUCH an amazing cook! My host father, Jun, is the Sabang Barangay Captain and loved to play the guitar and sing. Jolo is 14 and widely known as an amazing basketball player in the barangay (and Peace Corps). Tintin is 11 and an honors student, always studying and making beautiful school projects – and dancing to her favorite song, Twerk It Like Miley. Job is 3 and PASAWAY (naughty). He is also an avid dancer, and when not throwing toys and tantrums, can be kind of cute. The Lims welcomed me, a complete stranger, into their home, fed me well, and were the major reason why my stay in Morong was so wonderful. Thank you thank you thank you.

Lots of things are happening so fast now that PST is over and my service has begun. My next post will be about swearing in as official Peace Corps Volunteers at the Philippine U.S. Embassy, and my first few weeks at my permanent site Ayungon!
