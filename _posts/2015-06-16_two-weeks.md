I am packing up from my home in Lancaster, PA, where Iâ€™ve been living and working for the past year, to move back to my parentsâ€™ home in Southport, CT. I leave tomorrow. For the remaining two weeks in CT I will be unpacking, repacking, saying goodbye, and mentally and physically preparing to leave.

But in the meantime, I decided to create a timeline of my year-long Peace Corps application process. Hopefully this can help any future Peace Corps Volunteers (PCV) who have no idea whatâ€™s going on! Every PCV timeline will vary greatly, but Peace Corps wasnâ€™t lying when they said the course of the application usually takes about 12 months. My country assignment changed throughout the year, and therefore, so did my departure date. I had to stay flexible, unattached, and patient; which is much easier said than done.

Upfront, I was originally supposed to depart for Panama in February of 2015, but was not accepted into that specific program. I requested to rejoin the competitive process for an alternate assignment, and received an invitation to the Philippines, departing in July 2015! It was all meant to be, even though the first denial was quite upsetting. However, this new assignment allowed me to stay in Lancaster for a full year (a city that Iâ€™ve grown to love, and have set deep roots in), and it is bringing me back to Asia! Iâ€™ve traveled to China, Tibet, and India, and even though it wouldâ€™ve been amazing to travel to South America, Iâ€™m beyond ecstatic to return to Asia.

Here is the timeline, thus far:

* May 27, 2014: Submitted Peace Corps Application and Health History form.
* May 28, 2014: Response from Kathy Fidler, my recruiter, to set an interview date.
* May 30, 2014: Interview via web chat, lasted about an hour. Received a verbal nomination at the end of the interview: I was offered four countries in the Environment sector â€“ Ecuador, Panama, Ethiopia, and Mexico. I submitted Ecuador (Jan â€™15) and Panama (Feb â€™15) as my first and second choice, respectively.
* June 2, 2014: Response from Kathy Fidler to move forward with my nomination.
* June 16, 2014: Received official email nomination for Panama, Community Environmental Education.
* Sept 15, 2014: Received email from Julia Riddell, my new recruiter, informing me that I was not accepted into the Panama program. I opted to remain in the competitive process to be considered for an alternative placement.
* Sept 16, 2014: After my application was reviewed, I was offered a new nomination, and could choose from â€“ Nicaragua, Paraguay, and the Philippines. My first choice was the Philippines, Coastal Resource Management, departing July 2015!
* Sept 18, 2014: I received an official invitation to Peace Corps Philippines!!!!
* Sept 21, 2014: I accepted the invitation and began submitting passport and visa applications, and other paper work. Legal kit is sent to me.
* Oct 16, 2014: Peace Corps receives my Legal kit. Learning Space email received.
* Jan 13, 2015: I started this blog! Six months to go!
* Mar 20, 2015: Peace Corps started Legal Clearance Process.
* Mar 24, 2015: First Batch 274 email! Iâ€™ll be part of the 274th PCV group to go to the Philippines! It makes us sound like cookies, no?
* Mar 26, 2015: FINALLY submitted all of my medical forms. I shouldâ€™ve done this months ago. But I waited until the last minute. Donâ€™t do this.
* Apr 24 â€“ present: Receiving specific staging info, welcome letter, etc. And homework! Learn 50-100 Tagalog words/phrases, and interview two Filipino people here in the states about their experiences in-country!
* June 4, 2015: I passed medical clearance! Woo! Exactly one month until I fly out of the country!
* June 5, 2015: I booked my flight to LA for staging! (Through SATO Travel â€“ PC pays for the flight.)

* Looking ahead â€“ June 16, 2015: I leave Lancaster ðŸ˜¦
* June 23, 2015: My sister Ivy returns from her anthropology course in Brazil! (We tend to not stay in the same country for long). One week to go!

Iâ€™m glad this process took a year. Following my graduation from Franklin & Marshall college, I was slightly in limbo, but Iâ€™m so happy I had the opportunity to spend this time in Lancaster. I moved three times within the city, worked multiple jobs, started my own jewelry business, met wonderful people, and managed to stay in touch with many people from college and home in CT.
